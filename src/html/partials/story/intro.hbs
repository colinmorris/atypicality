Popular music is often looked on with cynicism as insipid and endlessly recycled. Critics of the top 40 might suggest that the key to making a hit song is just to copy and paste an earlier success with some superficial variation. But recent research suggests that the opposite may be true. In their paper <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0003122417728662">What Makes Popular Culture Popular? Product Features and Optimal Differentiation in Music</a>, professors Noah Askin and Michael Mauskapf analyzed 60 years worth of tracks from the Billboard Hot 100, and found that the songs that chart highest tend to be <i>less similar</i> to their predecessors than others. It pays to be different (though not <i>too</i> different).

The authors analyzed the songs in their dataset using <i>sonic features</i> - that is, properties calculated from the raw audio of the songs.
</p>
<p>
Let's go over some of those features. As an example, I'll be using <i>Believe</i> by Cher, which held the #1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks in 1999.

The grey region represents the 'average' song in the year before this song debuted on the charts. We can see that <i>Believe</i> is, overall, fairly typical for its time, with its most distinguishing characteristics being its high energy and low acousticness.

Let's take a note from Cher's book and <i>Turn Back Time</i> to the early years of the charts, as we explore some <i>atypical</i> hits through the years.
</p>

<p class="step" data-newsong="Dominique">
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO7cD6qmydo"><i>Dominique</i></a>, sung by Jeannine Deckers, "The Singing Nun" is certainly a bit of an oddity. First, there's the performer. At the time, the charts skewed toward attractive, young, all-American singers and groups - Lesley Gore, Bobby Vinton, The Four Seasons, The Chiffons. Deckers, an actual Belgian nun, singing in French, was not the typical <i>American Bandstand</i> type.
</p>

<p class="step" data-highlight_sonics="tempo danceability valence">
<i>Dominique</i> is a pleasant, upbeat song with a quick tempo and fairly high danceability and valence.
</p>
<p class="step" data-highlight_sonics="energy acousticness">
But what really sets it apart from the rest of the pack is the simplicity and sparsity of its production. Deckers' vocals are overdubbed in the chorus, but otherwise, it sounds as if she might have recorded it in one take in her bedroom with a tape recorder and a guitar. This is not a "Wall of Sound" production by any means. And this is reflected in the song's unusually low energy and high acousticness.
</p>

<p data-newsong="He's A Rebel">Compare to The Crystals' recording of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_SXJ18EkNw">He's a Rebel</a> a year earlier, a song with a very high typicality score.
</p>

<p>
Sonically, it feels like a much "bigger" song. There are a lot of instruments in the mix, compared to <i>Dominique</i>'s lone guitar, and, importantly, we have drums articulating a clear beat, aided by handclaps starting about halfway through. Over all the instrumentation, the vocals come through powerfully with rich harmonies, overdubbing and reverb. It's a classic Spector production, that's well deserving of its high energy score. (Though its high score for liveness compared to <i>Dominique</i> is a little questionable.)
